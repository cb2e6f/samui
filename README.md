[![Run Data Prep Workflow](https://github.com/chaichontat/loopy-browser/actions/workflows/data_prep.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/chaichontat/loopy-browser/actions/workflows/data_prep.yml)

Loopy Browser is a performant visualization tool for spatial transcriptomics experiments.

## Usage

Head over to https://loopybrowser.com/ to see the Loopy Browser with example Visium-IF data.

You need to preprocess your image to form a tiled structure prior to being used in the Loopy Browser.

### Preprocessing

Download a sample TIFF image from https://data.loopybrowser.com/VisiumIF/sample.tif.
The preprocessing system can be installed as described [below](#Installation).
Call the preprocessing GUI with the following command in the terminal.

#### GUI
```sh
conda activate loopy
loopy gui
```

<img width="712" alt="Loopy preprocessing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34997334/193870809-5338cbfa-9d7d-4e12-aca7-8a2c149eb2a2.png">

#### In the command line
```sh
conda activate loopy
loopy image [PATH TO IMAGE] --scale 0.497e-6 --channels Lipofuscin,DAPI,GFAP,NeuN,OLIG2,TMEM119
```
In this case, the output folder has the same name as the input file.

You can drag this folder directly to https://loopybrowser.com/.
Despite the Browser being a webpage, all data are processed locally on your computer.

**This link opens the expected result: https://loopybrowser.com/from?url=data2.loopybrowser.com/VisiumIF/&s=sample.**

Here, the browser retrieves the processed folder hosted on an external server.
You could share your files with your collaborators using your own file server or AWS S3.
More reasonably priced alternatives include [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) and [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html).
The images are available instantly and without any installation on their end!

### Annotation

There are two separate types of annotations in Loopy Browser.
Before annotation, you must set a label first.
The labels can be changed by double-clicking on the label names.

#### ROI Annotation
This is the typical kind of annotation you'd expect from other image viewers.
We simply draw figures that indicate regions of interest of the image.
The exported result is a JSON file that contains the coordinates of the drawn figures.
That is, the outputs are _coordinates and their labels_.
The exported results can be dragged back into the browser.

#### Feature Annotation
Here, we annotate the features or overlays that are either with the dataset to begin with or imported.
The ability to draw ROIs is simply there to facilitate annotation.
Each point can be annotated individually as well.
The outputs are _feature ID and their labels_.

## Installation

Install [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge3). These video guides can be helpful: [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=328DQUWZP48) and [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H_onyfW9VE). Then, in the Terminal, run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chaichontat/loopy-browser/
cd loopy-browser
conda env create -n loopy -f environment.yml
```

## Nomenclature

Being compatible with static hosting, Loopy Browser has most of its data all precomputed.

- `sample.json`: this contains the overall detail of the sample, such as its names and list of features.
- `{features}.json`: these are either headers for `ChunkedJSON` or headers and data for `PlainJSON`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Sample
    Overlay1 --> Feature1
    Overlay1 --> Feature2
    subgraph FeatureGroup
        Feature1
        Feature2
    end
    Overlay1 --> Feature3
    Overlay2 --> Feature4
    end
```
